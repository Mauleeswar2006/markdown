## What are the best oranges for juicing? 
When making orange juice at home, you have the option of experimenting with different orange types. Some good options include common oranges, navel oranges, Valencia, tangerines, clementines, satsuma, etc. You can also use blood oranges, when in season.

There isn’t one that is specifically ‘best’. It all depends on their availability, price, and which you prefer the flavor of.
Note: Navel orange juice can go bitter if not consumed immediately but is often considered one of the best-tasting oranges.

## How much juice is in one orange?
In a common (navel) orange, one orange will yield around 1/4-1/3 cup juice. Though, this can vary and will vary a lot between different types of orange.

## Is orange juice good for a cold ?
Yes! Because of the vitamin C content in oranges, this juice is great for reducing the symptoms and length of a cold.

## Can you freeze orange juice?
Yes, fresh orange juice will last between 3-4 months when frozen. I like to freeze mine portioned into XL ice-cubes for easy thawing and portion control.

## Is orange juice good for a sore throat?
Surprisingly, no. While the juice is great for a cold, the acidity in the juice may actually make sore throats worse as it can irritate the tender throat further.
