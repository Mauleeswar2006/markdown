**HOW TO MAKE ORANGE JUICE**
## WITH A JUICER 
Prepare the oranges by first peeling them. Then, chop them into smaller parts to fit your juicer chute.Then,add Some Sugar Preservativites. 

## WITH A BLENDER
Peel the oranges and, optionally, remove and discard the seeds(If needed)

Add the orange segments to a blender. You can add Sweet Preservativites a little water to help them blend if needed.

Blend into a juicy, pulpy consistency. Then sieve the resulting pulpy juice through a sieve or nut milk bag or alternatively if you like orange juice with pulp (for more nutrients too) then leave it as is.

## WITH A HANDHELD JUICER
This probably doesnâ€™t need much of an explanation. If you have a citrus juicer at home, simply chop the fruit in half, place it over the juicer, press down, and squeeze while rotating back and forth to get as much juice out as possible.

For orange juice with pulp, just spoon some directly out from the remaining orange (after squeezing the juice out) and add to your glass.
